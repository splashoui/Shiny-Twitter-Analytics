#### What is SLOPE?

In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line.Slope is often denoted by the letter *m* ; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in **O'Brien** (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as **"y = mx + b"** and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as **"y = mx + c"**.

#### Calculating the SLOPE
Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the "vertical change" to the "horizontal change" between (any) two distinct points on a line.

> m = [(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)]

where *x1 and y1* represent the coords of first point of the line **(x1,y1)** \
where *x2 and y2* represent the coords of end point of the line **(x2,y2)**

#### About the sign of the result

A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right. The slope is **positive**, i.e. *m>0*.\
A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right. The slope is **negative**, i.e. *m<0*.
